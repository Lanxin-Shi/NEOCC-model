# NEOCC-model
The New Energy and Oil Consumption Credits (NEOCC) model calibrated to 2016 to 2020 market, prices and fuel economies of the China automotive market, with partial data support by the China Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC). NEOCC maximizes industry profits by optimizing internal subsidies for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), fuel cell electric vheicles (FCEVs) and efficient conventional vehicles, subject to the policy compliance constraints. NEOCC takes into account: PEV and FCEV sales share and sales-weighted average fuel consumption requirements, incremental cost of fuel efficiency, range limitation of battery electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, consumer choice and central and local government incentives for PEVs and FCEVs. NEOCC can be used to analyze potential compliance strategies and profit impacts, including pricing strategies, technology challenges, government subsidy, and infrastructure needs. It can also be used to assess the potential impact on gasoline vehicles and gasoline demand.
